This is a simple, clean landing page built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Isotope JS.

It’s based on a Photoshop mockup called **Delta** — purchased from [Envato/ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/item/delta-onepage-psd-template/19220310). The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code — and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. It’s mobile responsive and includes a JavaScript category filter.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
